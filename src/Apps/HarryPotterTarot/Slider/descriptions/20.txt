If somebody asks about Draco Malfoy's Patronus one would say it is a dragon because after all he was named after these beasts and the same one would say that during saga that as the fanatic of a pure blood, son of the prominent death eater and later important ministry's official he represents their features like arrogance or constant self-aggrandizement over the others.
But it may be just an appearance. 
If somebody rode the book or even watched movie carefuly enough would notice that in their manor Malfoys were raising peacocks. Draco was growing up next to them. 
Many of his behaviors like arrogance or aggression which we can read at the first sight as being a dragon may be only illusion. He is fluffing up his feathers like the peacocks are doing by exposing proudly their beautiful colorful tails but when the true danger comes they're hiding from it and running out. Draco wants to kill Dumbledore but his personality stops him from doing so. That's why many people think that the peacock is the Draco's Patronus.
