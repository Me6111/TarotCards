Gallert Grindelwald was the one who pushed young Dumbledore to the evil path. Together they planned to take over the Magical and  the Muggle world. Dumbledore finally woke up and understood that it was a terrible mistake only after tragic death of his sister during the fight with Grindenwald which destroyed his family forever - it gave the only drive for Dumbledore's life which was to protect the world from Grindenwald. In the movie he is merely mentioned as the one who stool the Elder Wand but books are giving us the full picture of The Greatest, The most dangerous dark wizard which for years was ruling the Wizard World with iron fist, inprisoning his enemies in own Fortress Nurmengard. He seemed to not need special qualities as being the eir of the great snake wizard as Voldemort had or being disowned by his family or even needing Horcruxes. He was realizing the plan of global domination which later Voldemort continued until Dumbledore defeated him in the greates wizard duel of all time, and later defeated Voldemort which even didn't required him to be alive. 
He was remembered as the greatest sorcerer of all time whose life now is depicted by the new movies from Harry Potter saga.
