The sun is the Golden Snitch itself but that moment makes it even more symbolic.

Getting a Golden Snitch during a Quidditch match gives the great advantage or a victory to the team whose Seeker did so. 
It was Harry's job in during the match to find it. 

Upon his death, Albus Dumbledore left Harry the first golden snitch he had caught. Dumbledore put enchanted writing on the snitch that could only be read when Harry touched it to his mouth: "I open at the close".

Like a sun it was meant to give some warm rays of bravery to the Harry's heart when he was going to meet his fate. 
Until that moment it was the symbol of his glory, now it became a confirmation that it is finally an end. He could speak to his mom and dad to be not too sad when Voldemort will kill him.
