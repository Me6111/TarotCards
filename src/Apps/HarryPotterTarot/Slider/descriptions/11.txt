Alastor Moody was one of the greatest cops, scum-hunters and probably he was a psychopath - fortunately these dangerous features served in a good purpose. He was loosing parts of his body hunting dark sorcerers. I would like to see a movie about him and how the magical police works. He was the iron fist of the wizard's department of justice.
