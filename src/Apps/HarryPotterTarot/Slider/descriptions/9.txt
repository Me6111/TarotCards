The young Tom Riddle. Unpenetrable and mysterious evil mind. 
Hermit as the seeker of dark knowledge.
Young Tom Marvolo Riddle had the same lesson with the Bogart creature as the one Lupin did.
He saw himself. Dead himself. 
His parents never loved him. He wasn't the result of love. He was a mistake, an error. Jego matka poiła jego ojca eliksirem miłości.
Except of being the wyrzutkiem whose parents even didn't love him he had another quality making him special - he was the grand grand son of Salazar Slythering. The snake wizard. He inherrited all his qualities. He wasn't very scary or terryfying but the complete lack of love in his childhood, being someone special and sick ambition made him the most dangerous dark wizard of all time. 
By the way the actor who played him was really great.
