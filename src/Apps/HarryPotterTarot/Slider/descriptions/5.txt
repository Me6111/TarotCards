I thought about putting Ron as Hierophant because he was the one who was introducing Harry into Magical World and as his guide, the pure-blood wizard was teaching him everything.
I wasn't able to find even a moment when Ron behaves like a guide which he was in the books because the directors decided that better guide over magical world will be Hermione Granger, the daughter of two Muggles which all her life spent in the Muggles World than the pure-blood wizard from a large family whose all siblings were permanent part of Magical World and the better decision will be to make Ron someone who only can do is to panic. 
Mr. Weasley is the father of the family which became Harry's new family. Harry finally brought something good to the Weasley's family which thought to be damned with the useless Ron - until Ginny were born and became a girlfriend of great famous Harry Potter of course.
