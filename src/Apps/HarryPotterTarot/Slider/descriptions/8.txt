I'm sorry how movies destroyed the character of Neville - the potential chosen one whose parents were condemned to the fate much more terrible than the luxurious instant death which happened to Harry's parents because Lily Potter had that luck that Severus Snape still loved her. Even the moment when he finally gets the sword seems him to be a clumsy dumpling but the moment when he killed Nagini - even if truly spectacular doesn't shows the essence of the strength which pulling out the Gryffindor's sword does. 
Neville was awesome. He led the resistance in Hogwarts. In books we saw his change. His lack of confidence and anxiety were the results of the fate of his parents and high expectations of his grandma. Neville rose to the challenge and did a great job without any help from Dumbledore in contrary to Harry. I'm sure that if Neville was the chosen one, and Dumbledore helped him - Voldemort would be defeated in 2 days. He - the son of aurors deserved much more to be the chosen one than the son of the school's bully Harry Potter who owed his fame to only the fact that Voldemort killed his parents.
