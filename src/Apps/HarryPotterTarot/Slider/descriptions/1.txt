I couldn't imagine anyone better. All mighty, all knowing Dumbledore. Super intelligent, one of the greatest wizards of all time. He was the only one of who Voldemort was always truly afraid that killing him was his obsession. Starting from their first meeting and setting the Wardrobe on fire in which as young Tom Riddle he collected trophies after bullied orphans he couldn't hide anything from Dumbledore, he knew that he will never be able to return to Hogwarts until Dumbledore as long is alive. Always being 2 steps ahead of him even after his own death. He planned everything so well that he seemed to lead the events from beyond his own grave.
Dumbledore was the one who stood as the guardian preventing Voldemort from taking over the Magical World.  
All the events we see in Harry Potter saga are told from Harry's perspective but they are the result of Dumbledore's planning to finally defeat Lord Voldemort. Nothing happened without the knowledge of Dumbledore. He controlled everything from the back seat. Starting from inplacing Harry on Privet Drive, that he was assigned to Gryffindor even if the hat was thought about puting him in Slytherin, all the events ending on the one when he submitted to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest from his own will, accepting that his fate and trusting Dumbledore to the very end, despite his previous numerous manipulations and lies. Everything was his plan. He was the wisest, the most intelligent and despite the age of more than 100 years - the greatest wizard fighter who Voldemort himself wasn't able to defeat - making him the greatest wizard we ever seen. The true Magician.
