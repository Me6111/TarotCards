I decided to be not obvious this time by choosing some building to represent the tower and then trying to explain why. In this case tower is very special because it's a living person.
When I think about the tower, the most famous and accurate incarnation in the culture is Babel Tower. A very ambitious project which represents the mass of humanity's ambition to be equal to God which is condemned to failure. It's selfishness blinds it true purpose which is not to become equal to  its creator which is impossible but to fill the mission given by him which is to oppose to the evil.
Dolores Umbridge is very effective in the functions she's doing and very ambitious but too ambitious.
Even though she's doing her jobs very well, and being a very good servant - she with her master Cornelius Fodge is the face of the Ministry's bureaucracy. She seem to be not interested in anything else than the power. Her race for own greatness in buerucratical structure finally leads all the Ministry to ignore the Voldemort's return and puts both worlds Magical and Muggol in great danger.
