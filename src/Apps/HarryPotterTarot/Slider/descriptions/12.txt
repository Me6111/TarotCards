The Double agent, one of the greatest and talented wizards we ever seen, Half-Blood Prince, the master of potions, oclumency whose cold mind was unpenetrable even for the Dark Lord, the founder of a few spells including a powerful dark magical unforgivible curse. 
And the saddest man in all saga. His love tormented him all his life.
One of the most complicated people we ever seen. When he met Lily Potter he was good, after he realised she doesn't love him he became a Death Eater. After his master killed the one he always loved he helped to defeat him, and in the end as the double agend always in the reach of the hand but uncatchable he continued the Dumbledore's work after his death. He sacrificed his own life and he became the hero so great that even Harry Potter who hated him all his life - named his son with his name to great him.
