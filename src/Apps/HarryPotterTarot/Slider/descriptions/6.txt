I had a few options and the most obvious were of course Hermione and Ron, and I even had perfect shot for them when they finally kissed in the Chamber of Secrets after destroying he Horcrux. But i resigned from that.
This one is a hundred times better.
Lupin and Tonks. They died for their love.
The Beauty and the Beast. The witch from respected traditional wizard family fell in love with a werewolf dog. Nymphadora was excluded from her family and Voldemort himself ordered her cousin to kill her. 
One of the best lovers cards I can imagine.
