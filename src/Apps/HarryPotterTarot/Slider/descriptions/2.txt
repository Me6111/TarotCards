The most talented witch we saw. Especially that she even wasn't a pure blood wizard - both of her parents were Muggles but it didn't stop her from looking for the knowledge by her own and develop the abilities with which she surpassed even the experienced and merciless adult Death Eaters. She was able to resist even Bellatrix Lestrange's torture curse and in so young age she was able to effectively use Imperius Curse on a goblin to get to the highest protected bank vault in Magical World we know. She shows us that talent is not everything but the hard work and passion. I couldn't imagine better guardian of the magical knowledge and how great successes would she achieve later.
