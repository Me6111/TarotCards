Project description. 
I decited to build all the website as the art gallery of prompted images representing my ideas about the Death game but the problem was 'chaos' - I am not even going to explain the problem beacuse it's not worthy. Chaos is the best description. 
I spent more time on visual effects not being fully conscious that in my work is a big hole - I didn't considered enough WHAT exactly I'm going to show - it started to generate wastes of time.
I am going to tell here how I organized my thoughts of how the Death website should show.
The list of everything I should present - this is what I all the time was lack.

1. Number one was to create the art gallery which shows:
- how exactly the locations will look like
- what are the locations
- who will be enemies
- who will be bosses
- plan on the names of the locations
- my description why i chosen exactly that design
- events from life of Chuck Shuldiner and Death explaining the choice
- lyrics of songs
- quick access to listen the songs
- who will be the characters
- show my art for every thing and eventual prompt I had to write to create that picture + my reason why I chosen that design

What exactly you want to design? A section of the website or what? How will it be accessable through the main menu?
I decided to build everything around the single concept of 'Circles of Death' - which have source in pure Death lyrics.
Each circle is a death album. A single level.
Every single level has: 
- leitmotif/sin, 
- the enter portal, 
- location, 
- the sinners, 
- guide/friend, 
- 3 sub locations - infectors, 
- a boss, 
- the out portal 

For each we should have:
- DesignReason.txt (describtion of design),
- prompt.txt (which i used to generate photos), 
- prompts (folder with generated photos for every prompt.txt)








what information should we have clear for every level if we want to produce a game?



1. Plan/map for each level:

scream bloody gore (digestive system dungeon): 
'stomach cave', 'intestine dungeon', 'execution chamber' 

Leprosy (pit of sickness): 
'the pit', 'the village', 'infirmary'

Spiritual Healing (fields of intoxication): 
'elysian fields', 'jonestown', 'church'

Human (sea of emptiess):
'sea cave', 'underwater city', 'philosopher cave'

Individual thought patterns (forest of fear):
'head xray glade', 'forest of thoughts', 'fear copice'

Symbolic (crystal lake):
'black stream', 'frozen lake', 'crystal hills'

The sound of perseverance (the mountains of perseverance):
'hills of fear, 'abyss of strength', 'mountains of perseverance'

Duel with death (the abyss of world)




2. for every of these we need:
a folder or folder forest and in each folder:
- prompt.txt
- generated photos


3. for every level and its segment we need:
- location illustration
- list of enemies
- list of guides/friends


Whenever we enter an location - Chuck is infected with the sin of the place
Sin is a leitmotif of the album. Every album of death is describtion of a single circle of death. Each circle has a sin which leads to death
1. Scream bloody gore - carnage
2. Leprosy - decease
3. Spiritual healing - intoxication
4. Human - loneliness
5. Individual thought patterns - fear
6. Symbolic - hypocrisy 
7. The sound of perseverance - vanity

Enemies can be ones of 2 types:
- Infectors - the ones which are spreading the sin through the people. 
- The infected - the ones who submitted to the sin,  entered the circle of death but were too weak to pass the trial of character and finally became the slaves of death.

Friends will be our guides through the circle - they will fulfill the picture of the circles of death. 
They are the ones who won and passed the trial and walked through the circle of death. The death is not their enemy anymore but a friend.
