The Death tarot card, despite its ominous name, does not necessarily signify physical death. Instead, it symbolizes profound transformation, the end of one cycle to usher in a new beginning. It represents change, letting go of the old to make way for the new. This card often signifies a period of intense change, upheaval, or endings that can feel painful but ultimately lead to growth and renewal.
