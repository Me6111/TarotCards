The Hermit represents solitude, introspection, and the search for inner wisdom. It symbolizes a period of withdrawal from the world to seek answers within oneself. It encourages us to look inward, to confront our fears and limitations, and to find our true purpose. Â  

Bruce Wayne's journey to confront the Scarecrow mirrors this perfectly. After being traumatized by his encounter with the Scarecrow, Bruce retreats into seclusion, seeking solace and guidance in the remote Himalayan mountains. He embarks on a period of intense physical and mental training, confronting his deepest fears and limitations.

Like the Hermit, Bruce seeks answers within himself, searching for the inner strength and resilience to overcome his trauma and confront his enemies. He learns to control his fear, to master his emotions, and to find the courage to face the darkness within himself.
