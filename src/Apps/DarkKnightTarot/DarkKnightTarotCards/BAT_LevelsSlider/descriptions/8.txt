The Strength card represents inner strength, courage, and the ability to overcome challenges. It symbolizes gentleness, compassion, and the power of love and empathy.

Catwoman embodies these traits perfectly. Despite her life of crime, she possesses a strong moral code and a deep-seated compassion for the less fortunate. She is a skilled fighter and a formidable opponent, but she relies on her agility and cunning rather than brute force.

Like the Strength card, Catwoman demonstrates inner strength in the face of adversity. She overcomes her traumatic past and finds the courage to fight for what she believes in. She uses her skills and her understanding of human psychology to manipulate and outmaneuver her enemies, demonstrating a form of strength that transcends physical power.

However, the Strength card can also represent self-deception and the denial of inner conflict. While Catwoman displays incredible strength and courage, she also struggles with her own internal conflicts and the complexities of her past. She grapples with her desire for redemption and her lingering connection to the criminal underworld.
