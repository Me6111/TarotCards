The World tarot card represents completion and fulfillment. It signifies the end of a major cycle and the beginning of a new one. The card often depicts a figure dancing within a wreath, symbolizing joy, harmony, and the integration of all aspects of the self. Â  

The World card can be seen as a representation of Bruce Wayne's journey in the Dark Knight trilogy. After years of fighting crime and battling his inner demons, Bruce finally achieves a sense of peace and fulfillment. He retires from his vigilante persona and embraces a normal life with Selina Kyle in Florence. This peaceful ending, after overcoming numerous challenges and defeating his enemies, mirrors the sense of completion and wholeness embodied by the World card.
