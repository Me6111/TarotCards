The Wheel of Fortune represents change, cycles, fate, and the unpredictable nature of life. It symbolizes the constant ebb and flow of fortune, the ups and downs that we all experience in life. It reminds us that life is a journey of constant change and that we must adapt and evolve to navigate the unpredictable twists and turns of fate.

Batman's line perfectly encapsulates this concept. He understands that Gotham City is a constantly evolving entity, facing new and unpredictable threats. He recognizes that his role as Batman must also evolve, adapting to the changing circumstances and the ever-shifting needs of the city.

He embraces the unpredictable nature of his mission, acknowledging that he must constantly be prepared to face new challenges and overcome unforeseen obstacles. He accepts that his role is not fixed or predetermined, but rather a fluid and ever-changing one, dictated by the ever-shifting needs of the city he vows to protect.
