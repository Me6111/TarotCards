The Emperor represents authority, structure, discipline, and the ability to take control. He is a symbol of strength, stability, and the power to impose order upon chaos. He represents the father figure, the one who provides guidance, protection, and unwavering support.   

Commissioner Gordon embodies these traits perfectly. As the head of the Gotham City Police Department, he represents the established order, the force that strives to maintain law and order in a city plagued by chaos. He is a man of unwavering integrity, refusing to compromise his principles even in the face of overwhelming odds. He provides unwavering support to Batman, recognizing the need for unconventional methods to combat the city's escalating crime.   

Like the Emperor, Gordon exerts his authority with a firm but fair hand. He demands respect from his officers, while also earning their loyalty and admiration. He is a symbol of stability and order, providing a much-needed counterpoint to the chaos and corruption that permeates Gotham City.

However, the Emperor can also represent rigidity, inflexibility, and a reluctance to embrace change. While Gordon is a man of strong convictions, he can also be resistant to change and reluctant to embrace new ideas. This is evident in his initial skepticism towards Batman's methods, reflecting the Emperor's potential for rigidity and a reluctance to deviate from established norms.
