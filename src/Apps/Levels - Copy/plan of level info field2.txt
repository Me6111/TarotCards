Project description. 
I decided to build all the website as the art gallery of prompted images representing my ideas about the Death game but the problem was 'chaos' - I am not even going to explain the problem because it's not worthy. Chaos is the best description. 
I spent more time on improving visual effects not being fully conscious that in my work is a big hole - I didn't considered enough WHAT exactly I'm going to show - it started to generate big wastes of time.
I am going to tell here how I organized my thoughts of what the Death website should show.
The list of everything I should present - this is what I all the time was lack.

1. Number one was to create the art gallery which shows:
- how exactly the locations will look like
- what are the locations
- who will be enemies
- who will be bosses
- plan on the names of the locations
- my description why i chosen exactly that design
- events from life of Chuck Shuldiner and Death explaining the choice
- lyrics of songs
- quick access to listen the songs
- who will be the characters
- show my art for every thing and eventual prompt I had to write to create that picture + my reason why I chosen that design

What exactly you want to design? A section of the website or what? How will it be accessible through the main menu?
I decided to build everything around the single concept of 'Circles of Death' - which have source in pure Death lyrics.
Each circle is a different death album. A single level.
Every single level has: 
- leitmotif/sin, 
- the enter portal, 
- location, 
- the sinners, 
- guide/friend, 
- 3 sub locations - infectors, 
- a boss, 
- the out portal 

For each we should have:
- DesignReason.txt (description of design),
- prompt.txt (which i used to generate photos), 
- prompts (folder with generated photos for every prompt.txt),
- photos from interned showing by what exactly I was inspired

First thing which happens when we enter a location - Chuck's spirit is infected with the sin of the place.
Sin is a leitmotif of the album. Every album of Death is a description of a single circle of death. Each circle has a sin which leads to death
1. Scream bloody gore - carnage
2. Leprosy - decease
3. Spiritual healing - intoxication
4. Human - emptiness
5. Individual thought patterns - fear
6. Symbolic - hypocrisy 
7. The sound of perseverance - vanity

Enemies can be of 2 types:
- Infectors - the beings which are passing the sin to the people and they're feeding on their sin
- The infected - the ones who submitted to the sin,  entered the circle of death but were too weak to pass the trial of character and finally became imprisoned there for eternity as the slaves of death.
- The boss - guardian of the circle

Friends:
Friends will be our guides through each circle.
They are the ones who passed the trial and walked through the circle of death. The death is not their enemy anymore but a friend. 


what information should we have clear for every circle-level if we want to design a game's world?

1. Plan/map - every level has 3 stages:

scream bloody gore (digestive system dungeon): 
'stomach cave', 'intestine dungeon', 'execution chamber' 

Leprosy (pit of sickness): 
'the pit', 'the outcasted colony', 'infirmary'

Spiritual Healing (fields of intoxication): 
'elysian fields', 'town of believers', 'church of intoxication'

Human (sea of void):
'trench of depression', 'wasteland', 'philosopher cave'

Individual thought patterns (forest of fear):
'head-X-ray glade', 'forest of thoughts', 'swamp of fear'

Symbolic (crystal lake):
'black stream', 'frozen lake', 'crystal mountain'

The sound of perseverance (the mountains of perseverance):
'hills of fear, 'abyss of strength', 'mountains of perseverance'

Duel with death (center of the universe)
'the abyss of death'




2. for every of these we need:
a folder or folder forest and in each folder:
- prompt.txt
- generated photos


3. for every level and its segment we need:
- location illustration
- list of enemies
- list of guides/friends
